- turn on and off foreign key checks
- foreign key is wrong?
- shouldnt have data in referencing table, or need it in the referenced table ( get rid of the bad data)

- add row in refrenced table if foreign key is missing


 Disable primary keys, insert data, then test potential primary key using the SQL command below, where `a1,a2...an` are the potential primary key attributes, and r1 is the relation being test.
    ```
    SELECT b.* 
    FROM (
        SELECT <a1,a2,...an>, count(*) as cnt 
        FROM <r1> 
        GROUP BY <a1,a2,...an> 
        HAVING cnt >1) as one 
    LEFT JOIN <r1> as b 
    ON b.playerid = one.playerid 
    AND b.yearid = one.yearid 
    AND b.teamid = one.teamid 
    AND b.gameid = one.gameid 
    ORDER BY <b.a1, b.a2,...b.an>\G;
    ```
